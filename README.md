## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out this preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

✅ View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size;
❎ See hover states for interactive elements;

## About styles
My task was to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that I used my best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. Also information such as color palete and fonts can be found in `style-guide.md`.
