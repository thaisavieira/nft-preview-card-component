## Overview

### The Challenge

The challenge was about build out this preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The users should be able to:

âœ… View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size;

âœ… See hover states for interactive elements;

## About Styles
My task was to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that I used my best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. Also information such as color palete and fonts can be found in `style-guide.md`.

## My process

You can read about my process of building this project on my blog:[NFT Preview Card Component Challenge from Frontend Mentor](https://dev.to/thaisavieira/nft-preview-card-component-challenge-from-frontend-mentor-2471)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup;
- CSS custom properties;
- Flexbox.

### What I Learned

The most challenge part to me was  at the `.produt-image` hover. When the user hovers over the element it changes to image opacity, adds a background color, and shows an icon on top of the product image, so it's a little bit more complex and requires more attention and understanding of properties such as position, overflow, opacity, transition and the `::after` selector.
